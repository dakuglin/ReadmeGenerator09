## Description 

The purpose of this assignemt is to have code automitically generate a README file based on user input. The user is promped with a list of quesitons/verifications and the file is created based off the answers. This code is useful becuase it ensures that no aspect of a quiality README is missed or overlooked and also helps save a bit of time in generating the basic structure of the README. 

This project requires the use of packages from npmjs.com. We are using the Inquirer.js package to display questions to the user in the terminal. The fs package is also being used to write the markdowns provided by the user to the REAMME.md file.
